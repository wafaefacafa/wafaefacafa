- ⚡ 1. I used Google's Gemini 3 to write two game articles that were very popular, but no one knows the content from my main account. 
2. I am a Rainbow Six player. I bought the game in 2024 and have played for nearly 400 hours. The mechanics of Rainbow Six are really terrible, and recently I've often encountered Silver-ranked players teaming up with Copper or Bronze teammates to boost their rank. Normally, they shouldn't even match together. 
3. I'm a AAA game enthusiast. My EPIC account name is 战圣鹰眼 (searchable in Chinese), and my Steam ID is 1210509399. I've played Red Dead Redemption 2, Death Stranding, GTA, Cyberpunk 2077, and Warzone. I'm a loyal fan of the Assassin's Creed series. 
4. If possible, I hope to meet some developers.
